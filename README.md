#Hematovision: Advanced Blood Cell Classification Using Transfer Learning
Abstract
Accurate classification of blood cells is essential for diagnosing hematological conditions such as leukemia, anemia, and infections. This project, titled Hematovision, proposes an advanced deep learning pipeline leveraging transfer learning to automatically classify blood cells into distinct categories. Pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as ResNet50 and EfficientNet, are fine-tuned using annotated microscopic blood smear images. This approach achieves high classification accuracy while reducing the computational cost and time associated with training deep models from scratch.
1. Introduction
Manual examination of blood smears by hematologists is time-consuming and subject to human error. Automation using artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, offers a scalable and accurate alternative. Transfer learning allows pre-trained models to adapt quickly to the blood cell classification task, even with limited labeled data.

2. Related Work
Several studies have explored CNNs for classifying white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. However, training from scratch often requires large datasets. Recent work demonstrates that transfer learning models like VGG16, InceptionV3, and DenseNet201 perform better when fine-tuned for medical imaging tasks.
